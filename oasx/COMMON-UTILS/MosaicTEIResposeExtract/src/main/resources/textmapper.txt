If she read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a sick man, she longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a sick man;=1
Anna read and understood, but it was distasteful to her to read, that is, to follow the reflection of other people /u2019 s lives.=2
She remembered the ball, remembered Vronsky and his face of slavish adoration, remembered all her conduct with him:=3
For a moment she regained her self-possession,=4
The driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her and struggled with her over the door. But she enjoyed the struggle.=5
I have come after them and made repairWhere they have left not one stone on a stone,=1
We have to use a spell to make them balance:"Stay where you are until our backs are turned!"=2
My apple trees will never get acrossAnd eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.=3
And on a day we meet to walk the lineAnd set the wall between us once again.=4
Before I built a wall I'd ask to knowWhat I was walling in or walling out,=5
And he likes having thought of it so well45He says again, "Good fences make good neighbors."=6
Not long after, a concerned friend told her, "You need a newdog."=1
Jean "was having some difficulty getting around and ... was having trouble getting the dog enough exercise," explained Illmensee, 66, a retired teacher from Huntington, N.Y.=2
"They don't get the importance of seniors having animals.=3
"If I stop working, I couldn't afford to have him," Rogers explained.=4
Jennifer Devine, SWAP chairwoman and a geriatric social worker, said many seniors find that having a pet is soothing and reassuring, even with the extra work.=5
At Little Shelter in Huntington, there is a food pantry for those who can no longer afford pet food.=6
One study found that employees /u2014 both mentors and mentees /u2014 who participated in a mentoring program were 20% more likely to get a raise than those who were not in such a program.=1
Mentors also gain the satisfaction of knowing that they are helping to change lives for the better.=2
Mentors give kids a safe place to spend their free time, developing valuable social and communication skills in the process.=3
By being positive role models to young people, they are not only helping them to develop but giving back to their communities as well.=4
Remember that although mentors are not parents, they can have a great influence on a young person's life.=5
Many mentors say that they gain as much from mentoring as do their mentees.=6
A common misconception is that food automatically returns to the soil.=1
But although it does not seem as harmful as inorganic trash, food waste, in truth, is more harmful than most litter.=2
In addition to wondering who would discard a perfectly good orange, I couldn't imagine who would drop it onto the ground. Because, with the exception of cigarette butts, we just don't see people leave their trash behind as much these days as we did, say, twenty years ago.=3
Because it doesn't pile up like old newspapers; it just goes away, either down the disposal or into the trash.=4
And a good number of people, regardless of how they respond, don't behave as if it matters much.=5
Preliminary results suggest that elephants react most vigilantly to familiar warning calls, but they also crowd together and act nervous when they detect unfamiliar calls.=1
The learning curve suggests that the elephant had previously filtered out the seismic environment as noise. Now that she understands the task, she is focusing more attention to it, O'Connell-Rodwell said.=2
The vocalizations and foot stomps resonate at a frequency that elephants can detect in the ground, according to Caitlin O'Connell-Rodwell, a biologist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.=3
Peter Narins, a biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, says he's pleased to see her theory validated by a scientific study.=4
The scientist also believes that pressure-sensitive nerve endings in the elephants' feet and trunks are other pathways for detecting the vibrations of distant elephants.=5
O'Connell-Rodwell and her colleagues have also begun to study the nuances of elephant signals to distinguish them from the footsteps of rhinoceroses or lions.=6
he seguido sus pasos, y he reparado,los lugares donde no han dejado piedra sobre piedra,=1

que hace falta un hechizo para poder pararlas:" /ua1 No se muevan hasta que nos demos vuelta!"=3
