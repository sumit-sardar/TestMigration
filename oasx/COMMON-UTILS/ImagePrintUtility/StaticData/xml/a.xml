					&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early in May 1996, I
					was informed that a colony of bats roosting within
					an old wooden bridge in eastern New South Wales was
					about to lose its home. Demolition was due to
					commence within days to make room for a new concrete
					structure. Guessing that these particular bats were
					large&#x2011;footed bats (
					<i>Myotis adversus</i>
					), a threatened species, I quickly alerted
					environmental staff at the local city council in
					Lake Macquarie.

					of large&#x2011;footed bats in the Lake Macquarie
					area. From my point of view, the discovery was very
					exciting, but for the city council and their bridge
					construction company, it presented unforeseen
					obstacles. I developed a plan allowing the bridge to
					be replaced with minimal disturbance to the bat
					colony, and it was approved by both the city council
					and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. My

					role was to ensure the bats were safely excluded
					from the bridge and to attempt to re-establish their

					&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As demolition began,
					we progressively excluded the entire colony of bats
					from the cracks in the timbers where they roosted.
					Plastic flaps were placed over roost entrances so
					that the bats exiting at dusk were unable to
					re-enter after feeding. Using

					and some individuals were fitted with radio
					transmitters. By tracking the transmitter signals,
					we discovered an alternative roosting site among the
					concrete beams of a canal supplying water to a power
					station about 2&#x00A0;1/2&#x00A0;miles (4 km) away.

					&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the new bridge
					was partially completed, the construction crew moved
					roost timbers from the old wooden bridge into
					equivalent positions in the new concrete one. This
					method of incorporating pieces of the original roost
					into a new structure may actually be the first of
					its kind attempted.

					&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We had determined
					that, prior to the bridge replacement, a population
					of at least 170 large&#x2011;footed bats had roosted
					there. Also, the presence of many juveniles and the
					discovery that females outnumbered males
					approximately four to one suggested the bridge had
					been a maternity roost. Following completion of the
					new bridge, the Lake Macquarie City Council funded a
					monitoring program, and we have verified that
					large&#x2011;footed bats have re&#x2011;established
					roosts within the old timbers and are breeding
					successfully. Apparently the bats recognized their
					home!
