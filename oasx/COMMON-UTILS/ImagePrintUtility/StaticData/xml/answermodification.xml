										alt_text="When Mom woke me up that morning she was smiling from ear to ear. I don't know why you are so excited, I complained.  It's just a museum. Why do you think I'm going to enjoy visiting it today? You will see, she responded mysteriously. Mom had told me the week before that there was a traveling exhibit at the museum. She had said that I would be thrilled to find out what it was, but she kept the topic a secret. As I got ready that morning, I tried to imagine what the exhibit might be about. I tried to get hints from Mom over breakfast but she wouldn't say a word. As we took the bus to the museum I continued to ask questions, but Mom kept changing the sub ject. The moment I entered the museum, I knew Mom was right: I absolutely was delighted to spend the day there. I was amazed to find out that the entire exhibit was dedicated to my favorite thing in the world!"
