					     Early in May 1996, I was informed that a colony of bats
					roosting within an old wooden bridge in eastern New South Wales was
					about to lose its home. Demolition was due to commence within days
					to make room for a new concrete structure. Guessing that these
					particular bats were large?footed bats (
					<i>Myotis adversus</i>
					), a threatened species, I quickly alerted environmental staff at
					the local city council in Lake Macquarie.

					     Sure enough, an initial inspection revealed that this

					of large?footed bats in the Lake Macquarie area. From my point of
					view, the discovery was very exciting, but for the city council and
					their bridge construction company, it presented unforeseen
					obstacles. I developed a plan allowing the bridge to be replaced
					with minimal disturbance to the bat colony, and it was approved by
					both the city council and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.

					role was to ensure the bats were safely excluded from the bridge
					and to attempt to re-establish their roosts within the new
					structure.

					     As demolition began, we progressively excluded the entire
					colony of bats from the cracks in the timbers where they roosted.
					Plastic flaps were placed over roost entrances so that the bats
					exiting at dusk were unable to re-enter after feeding. Using

					and some individuals were fitted with radio transmitters. By
					tracking the transmitter signals, we discovered an alternative
					roosting site among the concrete beams of a canal supplying water
					to a power station about 2 1/2 miles (4 km) away.

					id="widget2909331005">     When the new bridge was partially completed, the
					construction crew moved roost timbers from the old wooden bridge
					into equivalent positions in the new concrete one. This method of
					incorporating pieces of the original roost into a new structure may
					actually be the first of its kind attempted.</text_widget>
				<text_widget halign="left" alt_text=" " width="430"
					id="widget2909331006">     We had determined that, prior to the bridge replacement, a
					population of at least 170 large?footed bats had roosted there.
					Also, the presence of many juveniles and the discovery that females
					outnumbered males approximately four to one suggested the bridge
					had been a maternity roost. Following completion of the new bridge,
					the Lake Macquarie City Council funded a monitoring program, and we
					have verified that large?footed bats have re?established roosts
					within the old timbers and are breeding successfully. Apparently
					the bats recognized their home!</text_widget>
