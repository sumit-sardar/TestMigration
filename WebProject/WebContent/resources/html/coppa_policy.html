The administrator of this test is advised that his or her education agency is solely responsible for compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA") as well as other laws applicable to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about students who will be accessing these services. Administrators should confirm with their agency that they are acting in compliance with all applicable laws relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about students. CTB/McGraw-Hill LLC ("CTB") may have access to demographic information about students including name, teacher, school, district, gender, race/ethnicity, grade, date of birth and student number as well as student responses to assessment questions for the purposes of reporting test answers, test scores, and test result analyses. This information is used to assess student performance and will be shared by CTB only with the test administrator who may share the information only as permitted by law. CTB/McGraw-Hill may use certain of this information in the aggregate for research purposes. 

It may be that public schools and non-profit non-public schools that do not use personal information for commercial purposes are not required to comply with COPPA. However, any compliance required under COPPA will be the responsibility of the school authority.
