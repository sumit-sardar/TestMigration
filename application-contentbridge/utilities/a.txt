He was so foolish and so easily cheated that everyone around town called him Juan Bobo, which means Juan the Fool in Spanish. He was always doing things that got him into trouble.</P><BR /><P ALIG
N="LEFT">One evening, as Juan was coming home after a long day of hard work in the fields, he saw three strange-looking bags hidden between the bushes to the side of the road. He looked inside and saw that they were filled with gold. He took the three bags home and showed them to his wife.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">She said, <I>"Ay, Dios mio, Juan!</I> That gold must belong to some wicked men! Don't tell anyone that you found that gold. It must be a secret."</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">But immediately she thought, <I>Ay, no,</I> my husband cannot keep any secrets. So she came up with a plan.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Juan, I need you to bring me a sack of cornmeal, three gallons of milk, three dozen eggs, and ten pounds of butter."</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Poor Juan had to go to town and bring everything his wife had asked for. He was so tired when he got back that he went right to sleep.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">As soon as he fell asleep his wife began to make <I>bunuelos</I>, fritters made of cornmeal, milk, eggs, and butter and deep fried like doughnuts. She spent that whole night kneading and cutting and cooking. She made so many <I>bunuelos</I> that they piled all the way to the ceiling. Then she took them outside and threw them all over the ground.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">The following morning Juan woke up and looked outside. He saw all of the ground covered with <I>bunuelos.</I> He couldn't believe his eyes. And Juan's wife said, <I>"Ay, Dios mio!</I> It must have rained <I>bunuelos</I> last night!" While poor Juan stood there looking at the ground and looking at the sky, puzzled over what had happened, his wife rushed to the stable where their donkey was eating from a pile of hay. The woman turned the donkey so that its tail faced the hay. Just then, Juan entered the stable and heard his wife saying, "This is a great miracle! Our donkey has been eating with its tail!"</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Poor Juan. He went to work with a terrible headache, amazed at the strange happenings of the day.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="
LEFT">About a week later three mean-looking men with long beards and matted hair showed up at the house. They said to the woman, "Where is the gold your husband's telling everyone he's found? He'd better give it back--or else!"</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Just then Juan walked into the house, and the men rushed to him, asking, "Where is the gold?"</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">With a pleased smile, Juan said, <I>"Mujer! </I>Bring out the gold you hid the other day."</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Looking very innocent, the wife answered, "I don't remember anything about any gold."</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Juan replied, "Sure you do. It was the gold I brought the day before it rained <I>bunuelos</I> and our donkey ate with its tail."</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">The three men looked at one another and said, "This poor soul must be crazy!" And they left, feeling sorry for the woman who had to put up with such a fool. From that day on, Juan Bobo and his wife lived a very pleasant and very comfortable life.</P><BR /></Passage><Acknowledgement><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Juan Bobo and the Bunuelos" retold by Lucia M.

Mike was Lydia's cousin, and he was nearly sixteen years old. "Now I can help you and Uncle Carlos round up the cattle."</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">"I don't think so, Lydia," said Mike. "This is hard work, and it can be dangerous. It's best if you go over by the pond and watch from there." Lydia looked over at the pond. It was a good quarter of a mile away from all the action.

She could do it, if only they would give her a chance.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">The pond was still frozen from the winter temperatures, but Lydia could see that the edges were beginning to melt.

Lydia ran around the pond, her lasso trailing behind her on the snow like a friendly snake. As soon as she scrambled down the bank of the pond, she saw the calf. It was one of the first tiny calves of spring. Somehow, in the excitement of the day, it had gotten separated from its mother. It must have walked out onto the thin ice and fallen through.

"This is hard work, and it can be dangerous. It's best if you go over by the pond and watch from there." Lydia looked over at the pond. It was a good quarter of a mile away from all the action. From there she would hardly be able to see anything. She certainly would not be able to help.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">"But Mike!" she pleaded. "You might need me."</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Lydia, go on to the pond." Mike walked off to join Uncle Carlos, and Lydia was left alone, as usual.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Lydia dragged her feet all the way to the pond. She lassoed a bush, and then she lassoed a fencepost. It just wasn't the same. She wanted to lasso cattle from high atop a horse. She could do it, if only they would give her a chance.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">The pond was still frozen from the winter temperatures, but Lydia could see that the edges were beginning to melt. She lassoed a log that had been frozen upright in the ice. This was boring.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Suddenly Lydia heard a sharp CRRAAACCKK! She whirled around, for the sound could mean only one thing. The ice on the pond was cracking. But why?</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Then she heard the soft moo. A calf! Lydia ran around the pond, her lasso trailing behind her on the snow like a friendly snake. As soon as she scrambled down the bank of the p
ond, she saw the calf. It was one of the first tiny calves of spring. Somehow, in the excitement of the day, it had gotten separated from its mother. It must have walked out onto the thin ice and fallen through. Now, only its head showed above the icy water and chunks of broken ice.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">The calf turned large, frightened eyes to Lydia. "Mooooo!" it said again, and Lydia knew she must save it.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">She grasped her lasso tightly. Then she told herself to relax. This was simple. She could lasso anything she put her mind to.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Taking a big breath, she threw the lasso at the calf's head. It fell short. She glanced over her shoulder at the men herding the cattle, but none of them were paying attention to Lydia. As usual.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">She gathered her lasso in her hands and threw it again. It bounced off the tip of the calf's soft pink nose.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Again Lydia threw the lasso. There! The loop draped perfectly around the calf's neck! She tugged on the rope, pulling the calf toward her like a tugboat pulling a ship through icy waters.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the calf was at the bank. Lydia's heart pounded as she reached down to remove the lasso and pull the calf from the water. She had saved its life!</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">As she turned around to guide the calf up the bank, she broke into a wide smile. At the top stood Mike and Uncle Carlos. They threw their hats up into the air and let out a loud, happy cheer. They had needed her help after all.</P><BR /></Passage><Acknowledgement><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Lydia's Lasso" by Lesli Favor, copyright (c) 2001 by CTB/McGraw-Hill.</P></Acknowledgement></Stimulus><Stem><P>As a result of what happened in this passage, Lydia will probably</P></Stem><SelectedResponse ID="483424" NumberAnswerChoices="4"><AnswerChoice ID="483425" Type="Distractor">ask for a calf to keep as a pet</AnswerChoice><AnswerChoice ID="483426" Type="Distractor">apologize to Mike and Uncle Carlos</AnswerChoice><An

The little birds push their bills through the animals' fur, searching for bloodsucking ticks and insects to eat. The big animals are happy to be rid of the pesky bugs. Their partners get full tummies and a high perch away from their enemies. The birds even sunbathe and sleep atop their furry homes. And from their high lookouts, the sharp-eyed birds warn their big partners of danger.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Galapagos tortoise and Darwin's finch<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador in South America<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The tiny finch hops up and down in front of the giant tortoise to get its attention. Then the big reptile lifts its neck way up and stretches out its legs. The little bird hops aboard and starts poking with its beak. It picks the annoying ticks from every nook and cranny of the tortoise's leathery skin. The tortoise stands still, happy to be cleaned. And the finch is happy to have a full belly.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Flashlight fish and bacteria<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Coral reefs in the Indian Ocean<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> Billions of glowing bacteria live in pockets under the eyes of the fish. Here the bacteria get food and a safe place to live. And the fish gains two bright lights to blink on and off with its special eyelids. The fish uses the lights to flash code messages to other flashlight fish, to find food and to confuse enemies. When it spots an enemy, the small fish blinks its light, then scoots away. The enemy swims toward the light, but finds that the flashlight fish is long gone.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Hermit crab and sea anemone<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Throu
ghout the oceans<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The hermit crab needs a weapon to ward off enemies. What does it do? It carries a sea anemone, a flowerlike animal with stinging tentacles, on its shell. Enemies now must stay clear or get stung. In return, the sea anemone gets a ride to all the food it wants. One species of anemone even produces material the crab uses to make its shell larger. The crab carrying this species of anemone never has to move to a bigger home!</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Clown fish and sea anemone<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Warm shallow waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The small clown fish needs a safe place to hide because its bright color and poky swimming make it an easy target for large, hungry fish. What better hiding place than a sea anemone's tentacles? These deadly, stinging "fingers" keep big fish away, while a special mucus on the clown fish protects it from the anemone's stings. In return, the fearless clown fish drives away butterfly fish, which like to eat sea anemones.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Large fish like sharks and smaller "cleaner" fish<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Oceans of the world, especially around coral reefs<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> Sharks and other large fish line up at "cleaning stations" near coral reefs or rocks. Little "cleaner" fish set to work nibbling away their big customers' parasites and cleaning their wounds. Without the cleaners, the large fish could get sick. The big fish stay still for the little cleaners and even let them swim into their mouths. The bright colors or stripes of the cleaners tell the big fish not to eat them. While the little fish clean, they get a free meal and safety.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Dwarf mongoose and hornbill<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Taru Desert of Kenya in Africa<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> In the morning, hornbills perch in trees near sleeping mongooses, waiting for them to wake up. The birds want to tag along as the animals search for food. T
he hornbills know they can depend on the mongooses to flush out food they both like, such as beetles or mice. Then the birds will be right there to get a good meal. In return, the birds act as lookouts for their partners. The birds not only warn of danger to both animals, but also of enemies just to mongooses, such as birds of prey and snakes. This suggests that the two animals have been a team for a long time.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Ants and butterfly caterpillars<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Throughout the world<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The caterpillars of butterflies, like the hairstreak, bluestreak, and metalmark, need the ants to protect them from wasps. Just one ant of any of about 100 species can fight off a wasp. The caterpillars make a drumming sound to let ants know where they are. The ants come running to help out because the caterpillars make sugary food the ants can't resist. When a wasp swoops down to snatch a caterpillar for its young, the ants are ready to attack. The reward? When an ant tickles the caterpillar with its antennae, <I>presto</I>, a sugary treat appears!</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Honey guide and honey badger <BR /><B>HOME:</B> Africa and Southern Asia<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The honey guide, a small bird, is expert at finding beehives faster than any other animal or human. But it can't break a hive open with its tiny bill. So it calls on the honey badger. The badger follows the bird to the hive and easily rips it open with its claws. Both animals get their favorite food--honey for the badger and beeswax for the bird. What a sweet team!</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Snapping shrimp and goby fish<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Sandy bottoms of the Indian and Pacific Oceans<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The tiny snapping shrimp is a great digger, but it can barely see. So it has a "seeing-eye fish." Its partner is a goby fish, which has sharp eyes but can't dig. The shrimp and fish share a burrow--dug by the shrimp and guarded by the goby. When
ever the shrimp is outside the burrow, it keeps one antenna on the goby. At any sign of danger, the goby flicks its tail to warn the shrimp. Together they dive into the burrow.</P><BR /></Passage><Acknowledgement><P ALIGN="LEFT">"It Takes Teamwork" by Janet Halfmann, copyright (c) 1998 by Janet Halfmann, first published in <I>Boys' Life</I> Magazine's December 1998 issue.

These teams live everywhere, from your backyard to the deepest ocean.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Scientists call teamwork between different kinds of animals <I>symbiosis</I> (sim-bee-OH-sis). Here's a peek at a few of these odd couples.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Oxp
eckers and impalas, giraffes, rhinoceroses and other African mammals<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Grasslands and savannas of Africa<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS: </B>Oxpeckers, or tickbirds, keep big African animals like the impala from being "ticked off." The little birds push their bills through the animals' fur, searching for bloodsucking ticks and insects to eat. The big animals are happy to be rid of the pesky bugs. Their partners get full tummies and a high perch away from their enemies. The birds even sunbathe and sleep atop their furry homes. And from their high lookouts, the sharp-eyed birds warn their big partners of danger.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Galapagos tortoise and Darwin's finch<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador in South America<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The tiny finch hops up and down in front of the giant tortoise to get its attention. Then the big reptile lifts its neck way up and stretches out its legs. The little bird hops aboard and starts poking with its beak. It picks the annoying ticks from every nook and cranny of the tortoise's leathery skin. The tortoise stands still, happy to be cleaned. And the finch is happy to have a full belly.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Flashlight fish and bacteria<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Coral reefs in the Indian Ocean<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> Billions of glowing bacteria live in pockets under the eyes of the fish. Here the bacteria get food and a safe place to live. And the fish gains two bright lights to blink on and off with its special eyelids. The fish uses the lights to flash code messages to other flashlight fish, to find food and to confuse enemies. When it spots an enemy, the small fish blinks its light, then scoots away. The enemy swims toward the light, but finds that the flashlight fish is long gone.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Hermit crab and sea anemone<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Throughout the oceans<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The hermit crab needs a
 weapon to ward off enemies. What does it do? It carries a sea anemone, a flowerlike animal with stinging tentacles, on its shell. Enemies now must stay clear or get stung. In return, the sea anemone gets a ride to all the food it wants. One species of anemone even produces material the crab uses to make its shell larger. The crab carrying this species of anemone never has to move to a bigger home!</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Clown fish and sea anemone<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Warm shallow waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The small clown fish needs a safe place to hide because its bright color and poky swimming make it an easy target for large, hungry fish. What better hiding place than a sea anemone's tentacles? These deadly, stinging "fingers" keep big fish away, while a special mucus on the clown fish protects it from the anemone's stings. In return, the fearless clown fish drives away butterfly fish, which like to eat sea anemones.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Large fish like sharks and smaller "cleaner" fish<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Oceans of the world, especially around coral reefs<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> Sharks and other large fish line up at "cleaning stations" near coral reefs or rocks. Little "cleaner" fish set to work nibbling away their big customers' parasites and cleaning their wounds. Without the cleaners, the large fish could get sick. The big fish stay still for the little cleaners and even let them swim into their mouths. The bright colors or stripes of the cleaners tell the big fish not to eat them. While the little fish clean, they get a free meal and safety.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Dwarf mongoose and hornbill<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Taru Desert of Kenya in Africa<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> In the morning, hornbills perch in trees near sleeping mongooses, waiting for them to wake up. The birds want to tag along as the animals search for food. The hornbills know they can depend on the mongooses to flush out food the
y both like, such as beetles or mice. Then the birds will be right there to get a good meal. In return, the birds act as lookouts for their partners. The birds not only warn of danger to both animals, but also of enemies just to mongooses, such as birds of prey and snakes. This suggests that the two animals have been a team for a long time.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Ants and butterfly caterpillars<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Throughout the world<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The caterpillars of butterflies, like the hairstreak, bluestreak, and metalmark, need the ants to protect them from wasps. Just one ant of any of about 100 species can fight off a wasp. The caterpillars make a drumming sound to let ants know where they are. The ants come running to help out because the caterpillars make sugary food the ants can't resist. When a wasp swoops down to snatch a caterpillar for its young, the ants are ready to attack. The reward? When an ant tickles the caterpillar with its antennae, <I>presto</I>, a sugary treat appears!</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Honey guide and honey badger <BR /><B>HOME:</B> Africa and Southern Asia<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The honey guide, a small bird, is expert at finding beehives faster than any other animal or human. But it can't break a hive open with its tiny bill. So it calls on the honey badger. The badger follows the bird to the hive and easily rips it open with its claws. Both animals get their favorite food--honey for the badger and beeswax for the bird. What a sweet team!</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Snapping shrimp and goby fish<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Sandy bottoms of the Indian and Pacific Oceans<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The tiny snapping shrimp is a great digger, but it can barely see.

It's called teamwork--both working toward a common goal, in this case, survival.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">The animal world also has many examples of teamwork.

Here's a peek at a few of these odd couples.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Oxpeckers and impalas, giraffes, rhinoceroses and other African mammals<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Grasslands and savannas of Africa<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS: </B>Oxpeckers, or tickbirds, keep big African animals like the impala from being "ticked off." The little birds push their bills through the animals' fur, searching for bloodsucking ticks and insects to eat. The big animals are happy to be rid of the pesky bugs. Their partners get full tummies and a high perch away from their enemies. The birds even sunbathe and sleep atop their furry homes. And from their high lookouts, the sharp-eyed birds warn their big partners of danger.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Galapagos tortoise and Darwin's finch<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean 600 miles off the coast
 of Ecuador in South America<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The tiny finch hops up and down in front of the giant tortoise to get its attention. Then the big reptile lifts its neck way up and stretches out its legs. The little bird hops aboard and starts poking with its beak. It picks the annoying ticks from every nook and cranny of the tortoise's leathery skin. The tortoise stands still, happy to be cleaned. And the finch is happy to have a full belly.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Flashlight fish and bacteria<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Coral reefs in the Indian Ocean<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> Billions of glowing bacteria live in pockets under the eyes of the fish. Here the bacteria get food and a safe place to live. And the fish gains two bright lights to blink on and off with its special eyelids. The fish uses the lights to flash code messages to other flashlight fish, to find food and to confuse enemies. When it spots an enemy, the small fish blinks its light, then scoots away. The enemy swims toward the light, but finds that the flashlight fish is long gone.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Hermit crab and sea anemone<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Throughout the oceans<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The hermit crab needs a weapon to ward off enemies. What does it do? It carries a sea anemone, a flowerlike animal with stinging tentacles, on its shell. Enemies now must stay clear or get stung. In return, the sea anemone gets a ride to all the food it wants. One species of anemone even produces material the crab uses to make its shell larger. The crab carrying this species of anemone never has to move to a bigger home!</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Clown fish and sea anemone<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Warm shallow waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The small clown fish needs a safe place to hide because its bright color and poky swimming make it an easy target for large, hungry fish. What better hiding place than a sea anemone's tentacles? These deadly, stingin
g "fingers" keep big fish away, while a special mucus on the clown fish protects it from the anemone's stings. In return, the fearless clown fish drives away butterfly fish, which like to eat sea anemones.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Large fish like sharks and smaller "cleaner" fish<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Oceans of the world, especially around coral reefs<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> Sharks and other large fish line up at "cleaning stations" near coral reefs or rocks. Little "cleaner" fish set to work nibbling away their big customers' parasites and cleaning their wounds. Without the cleaners, the large fish could get sick. The big fish stay still for the little cleaners and even let them swim into their mouths. The bright colors or stripes of the cleaners tell the big fish not to eat them. While the little fish clean, they get a free meal and safety.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Dwarf mongoose and hornbill<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Taru Desert of Kenya in Africa<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> In the morning, hornbills perch in trees near sleeping mongooses, waiting for them to wake up. The birds want to tag along as the animals search for food. The hornbills know they can depend on the mongooses to flush out food they both like, such as beetles or mice. Then the birds will be right there to get a good meal. In return, the birds act as lookouts for their partners. The birds not only warn of danger to both animals, but also of enemies just to mongooses, such as birds of prey and snakes. This suggests that the two animals have been a team for a long time.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Ants and butterfly caterpillars<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Throughout the world<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The caterpillars of butterflies, like the hairstreak, bluestreak, and metalmark, need the ants to protect them from wasps. Just one ant of any of about 100 species can fight off a wasp. The caterpillars make a drumming sound to let ants know where they are. The ants come running to help out because th
e caterpillars make sugary food the ants can't resist. When a wasp swoops down to snatch a caterpillar for its young, the ants are ready to attack. The reward? When an ant tickles the caterpillar with its antennae, <I>presto</I>, a sugary treat appears!</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Honey guide and honey badger <BR /><B>HOME:</B> Africa and Southern Asia<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The honey guide, a small bird, is expert at finding beehives faster than any other animal or human. But it can't break a hive open with its tiny bill. So it calls on the honey badger. The badger follows the bird to the hive and easily rips it open with its claws. Both animals get their favorite food--honey for the badger and beeswax for the bird. What a sweet team!</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>TEAMMATES:</B> Snapping shrimp and goby fish<BR /><B>HOME:</B> Sandy bottoms of the Indian and Pacific Oceans<BR /><B>HOW THE TEAM WORKS:</B> The tiny snapping shrimp is a great digger, but it can barely see. So it has a "seeing-eye fish." Its partner is a goby fish, which has sharp eyes but can't dig. The shrimp and fish share a burrow--dug by the shrimp and guarded by the goby. Whenever the shrimp is outside the burrow, it keeps one antenna on the goby. At any sign of danger, the goby flicks its tail to warn the shrimp. Together they dive into the burrow.</P><BR /></Passage><Acknowledgement><P ALIGN="LEFT">"It Takes Teamwork" by Janet Halfmann, copyright (c) 1998 by Janet Halfmann, first published in <I>Boys' Life</I> Magazine's December 1998 issue.

And we feel great--as if we were walking on top of the world. </P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">We're in a mountain range near where we live in British Columbia, Canada. These mountains are so high that the snow never melts--even in summer. (The higher you go, the colder the air is.) Instead of melting, the snow piles up in layers, year after year. Slowly it packs down to form super-thick sheets of ice called glaciers (GLAY-shurz). </P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Fred told us that glaciers flow downhill.

There's another 'river of ice' flowing down that mountain right behind us." </P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Long Haul Up</B></P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">You should've seen what we had to go through to get here. It was an uphill hike of about 3,000 feet (900 meters). The climb from the green valley below was mostly steep and rocky. I was first to scramble over the last rocks and onto this glacier. Ahh!

Fred knows all about climbing on glaciers safely. He tied us to the rope and handed each of us an ice axe. The axes made handy walking sticks.

On our way to check one out, Fred tells us how these ice cracks form.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">"If the glacier flows over a hill or is forced around a sharp corner, the ice on the surface may crack open.

hat a "cool" way to spend summer vacation. Join us as we explore this high-in-the-sky river of ice. </P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Can you believe it? Here we are, hiking on snow and ice in the middle of summer! Ian, my brother, is leading the way along a snowy ridge. I'm bringing up the rear. Our friend, Guy, is in the middle. </P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Fred, our guide, is ahead of us, hollering back encouragement: "You guys are doing great!" And we feel great--as if we were walking on top of the world. </P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">We're in a mountain range near where we live in British Columbia, Canada. These mountains are so high that the snow never melts--even in summer. (The higher you go, the colder the air is.) Instead of melting, the snow piles up in layers, year after year. Slowly it packs down to form super-thick sheets of ice called glaciers (GLAY-shurz). </P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Fred told us that glaciers flow downhill. "They're just like rivers," he explained, "except that they flow v-e-r-y slowly, maybe only a few inches a day. There's another 'river of ice' flowing down that mountain right behind us." </P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Long Haul Up</B></P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">You should've seen what we had to go through to get here. It was an uphill hike of about 3,000 feet (900 meters). The climb from the green valley below was mostly steep and rocky. I was first to scramble over the last rocks and onto this glacier. Ahh! I thought, and closed my eyes. Nothing like a freezing-cold sheet of ice on a hot summer day. Then I felt the snowballs hit my head. "Youch!" Obviously Ian and Guy had made it onto the glacier too.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Learning the Ropes</B></P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Ropes are important tools for glacier travel. If I start to slip, the others can anchor themselves with their ice axes. Then the rope connecting us will keep me from falling.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Before you start wandering around, you need to be equipped," Fred had told us, uncoiling some long, thick rope. Fred knows a
ll about climbing on glaciers safely. He tied us to the rope and handed each of us an ice axe. The axes made handy walking sticks. But to keep from slipping down slopes, we can use the pointed ends to grip the ice.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Fred showed us how to walk on the glacier. The rope--our safety line--keeps us tied together. And now here we are, testing our new skills.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">We're on a narrow ridge and the snowy ground slopes sharply downward on either side of our feet. That makes things a little--uh--exciting. Guy says, "If I start to slide off one side of the ridge, you guys hop off the other side to stop my fall." Then he thinks about it a bit. "Guess maybe that's not such a good idea, huh?"</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Cracking Up</B></P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">We take each step with caution. In fact, Fred won't let us go anywhere that's unsafe. A glacier can be dangerous. It can gobble people up. You think I'm joking? Then you haven't heard of a crevasse (kruh-VASS)! On our way to check one out, Fred tells us how these ice cracks form.</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">"If the glacier flows over a hill or is forced around a sharp corner, the ice on the surface may crack open. It's like a chunk of modeling clay that cracks or breaks if you pull or bend it too quickly."</P><BR /><P ALIGN="LEFT">We take turns peeking into the icy mouth of one of these cracks in the glacier.
